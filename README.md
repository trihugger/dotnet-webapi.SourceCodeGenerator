.NET WebAPI Boilerplate Template built with .NET 6.0. Incorporates the most essential Packages your projects will ever need. Follows Clean Architecture Principles.

## About

`dotnet-webapi-boilerplate` is the integral part of the `fullstackhero` project.

`fullstackhero` is a venture to develop industry leading boilerplate templates for the dotnet stack as the backend (webapi) along with modern client frameworks like Angular, MVC and Blazor.

This repository contains the WebApi Project of `fullstackhero`.

## Release Planning

### 0.0.1 RC is available now!

This is the first pre-release version of the `fullstackhero .NET WebAPI Boilerplate` package. Newer versions will be available on a weekly basis with newer updates and patches. [Read the getting-started guide for more.](https://fullstackhero.net/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/getting-started/)

The Release Version is expected to be out by Novemeber, 2021 as soon as .NET 6 LTS is launched by Microsoft. Preview versions of this project is available for Initial Developer Testing.

## Quick Start Guide

Open up your Command Prompt / Powershell and run the following command to install the solution template.

```powershell
dotnet new --install FullStackHero.WebAPI.Boilerplate
```
This would install the `fullstackhero .NET WebAPI Boilerplate` template globally on your machine. With that done, let's see how you can start generating complete .NET WebAPI Solutions seamlessly.

Simply navigate to a new directory (wherever you want to place your new solution at), and open up Command Prompt at the opened directory.

Run the following command. Note that, in this demonstration I am naming my new solution as `FSH.Starter`.

```powershell
dotnet new fsh-api -o FSH.Starter
```
